Convert the VBA script from excel file to python script is main objective here.
There are list of VBA script module enclose with ''' and seperated by '\n\n' from each other.
Create python project or file with followin details.
    1. Create python project or file based on data complexity from VBA script model  with class name as 'ConvertedExcelMacros'.
    2. Add constructor with input data is  dataframe object as argument which is used with converted python function.
    3. Convert the each model into python equivalent function and add into above class with following point to be consider.
        a. Check for dependecies and respetive library require in python and add at top of file.
        b. Check indentation and syntax error.
        c. if failed to convert , then create function with description and add log statement about error when this function get call
    
    4. Add operation function to this call which ask user to select operation based on python function available and execute the selected python function with excel file data present in dataframe.
    5. Finally, add main function with ask for input file , read input excel file into dataframe , process operation function and updatee same excel file with updated dataframe.
    6. Dont provide any example and description in python file just normal comments.
    7. Python file must be executable. Recheck the structure, indentation, and extra mark,symbol and remove it if not require.
